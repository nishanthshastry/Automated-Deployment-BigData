# Automated-Deployment-BigData

A simple **Research oriented project on Automated Deployment** using BigData Technologies.

The project is a complete representation of BigData Concepts along with ML and Python programming. It is automated with the facility of bash scripts connecting the dataset from **MYSQL** to **HIVE** and hence used by **Spark-pyspark** for further computation.

This project presents an innovative way of integrating machine intelligence to an automated deployment procedure. The master node keeps getting better in understanding the computers in its cluster as it has an inbuilt Machine Learning model which uses k - Nearest Neighbours Algorithm.
